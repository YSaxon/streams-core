## Introduction

You might consider starting with the [Streams starter application](/docs/installation).


### Download

Download the Streams Core package using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

```bash
composer require streams/core
```


## Updating

From within your project, use Composer to update individual packages:

```bash
composer update streams/core --with-dependencies
```

You can, of course, update your entire project using `composer update`.
